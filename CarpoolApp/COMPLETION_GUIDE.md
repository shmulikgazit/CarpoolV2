## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Data already exists in Firebase"

**Solution**: This is fine! It means you already initialized data. You can:
- Skip initialization and proceed to testing
- OR delete data from Firebase Console and re-run

### Issue: "Cannot connect to Firebase"

**Solution**: Check:
1. Internet connection is active
2. Firebase config in `src/services/firebase.js` is correct
3. Try: `npm install firebase` again

### Issue: "Expo Go can't connect"

**Solution**: Make sure:
1. Phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
2. Firewall is not blocking Expo
3. Try: `npm start -- --tunnel` for tunnel mode

### Issue: "App crashes on startup"

**Solution**:
1. Clear cache: `npm start -- --clear`
2. Restart Expo: `Ctrl+C` then `npm start`
3. Check logs in terminal for error messages
