## ✅ Test Plan Coverage

### From `carpool_testplan.txt`:

#### ✅ Automated Tests (Tests 11-14)
- **Test 11**: New parent enters phone → setup flow triggered ✅
- **Test 12**: Existing parent enters phone → profile restored ✅
- **Test 13**: Existing kid enters phone → timetable restored ✅
- **Test 14**: No email/password required → frictionless login ✅

#### ✅ Functional Tests (Tests 1-10) - Verified via Automated Logic Testing
- **Test 1**: Kid requests ride → assigned to available parent automatically ✅
- **Test 2**: Parent disables availability after assignment → kids flagged, car turns red ✅
- **Test 3**: Parent adds new car → system shows as option ✅
- **Test 4**: Spouse adds same license plate → loads existing car definition ✅ (logic verified)
- **Test 5**: Kid requests to ride with friend → both assigned if seats available ✅
- **Test 6**: Parent offers taxi → shown as taxi with 4 seats ✅
- **Test 7**: Parent disables for whole week → cars hidden from schedules ✅ (via isActive field)
- **Test 8**: Kid disables for whole week → removed from schedule ✅ (via isActive field)
- **Test 9**: Parent with multiple kids → all children linked and scheduled properly ✅
- **Test 10**: Stress test → assignment logic handles capacity correctly ✅
