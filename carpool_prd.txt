Carpool App - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

1. Overview
- Goal: Simplify daily carpool coordination between parents and children.
- Primary Users: Parents, children (school age), and indirectly schools.
- Platforms: iOS & Android (mobile-first), Firebase backend.

2. Core Features
- Timetable management (kids).
- Availability management (parents, cars).
- Carpool assignment engine (auto + manual adjustments).
- Visual schedule display (cars, seats, kids’ names).
- Conflict handling (withdrawals, unassigned kids, reassignment).
- Notifications & chat.
- Settings & profiles (parents, kids, cars, schools).
- Taxi fallback option.

3. User Stories
- As a parent, I want to mark myself unavailable for a shift so the system can reassign kids.
- As a kid, I want to request to ride with a friend so I feel happier in carpool.
- As a parent, I want to see a live schedule with car and seat availability so I can adjust quickly.
- As a parent with multiple kids, I want all my kids’ schedules linked to me.

4. Functional Requirements
- Parents can define cars, plate numbers, availability, and offer taxis.
- Kids define timetable, grade, and request rides.
- Assignments must recalculate dynamically based on availability.
- Cars must not exceed defined seat capacity.
- Conflict notifications (withdrawals, unassigned kids) displayed to all relevant users.
- Multiple kids can be linked to one parent.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Carpool assignments must update in <3 seconds.
- Scalability: Support up to 200 families per school.
- Reliability: Firebase data persistence.
- Usability: Intuitive mobile UI for non-technical parents.
- Availability: 99.5% uptime for backend services.


6. Identity & Authentication
- Phone number is the **unique identifier** for both parents and kids (no email, no passwords).
- SMS verification is **deferred** for now, but designed to be added later without breaking compatibility.
- When a user enters their phone number, the backend will look up existing configuration (role, settings, cars, kids, timetable).
- If found, the app will restore the data for quick continuation on a new phone.
- If not found, the app will guide the user through setup as parent or kid.
